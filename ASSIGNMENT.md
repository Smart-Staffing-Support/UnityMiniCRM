# MiniCRM Take-Home Assessment: Build Your Feature

## Overview
Welcome! This is a practical coding assessment designed to evaluate your full-stack development skills, creativity, and decision-making. You'll be adding **a feature of your choice** to our existing MiniCRM application.

## Time Limit
**48 hours** from the time you receive this assignment.

## Background
MiniCRM is a simple customer relationship management application that currently manages Leads, Contacts, and Reminders. Your task is to extend this system by implementing a feature that you believe would add significant value to a CRM system.

## Your Task

**Choose ONE feature to implement** that demonstrates your technical skills and product thinking. You have complete freedom in your choice, but it should:

1. **Add meaningful value** to the CRM system
2. **Include both backend and frontend** components
3. **Integrate with existing models** (Leads, Contacts, or Reminders)
4. **Be completable within 48 hours** (scope appropriately)
5. **Demonstrate your technical strengths**

---

## Core Requirements

Regardless of which feature you choose, your implementation must include:

### 1. Backend (Django REST Framework)
- **Data Model(s):** At least one new model with proper fields and relationships
- **API Endpoints:** RESTful endpoints for your feature (minimum: list, create, retrieve, update, delete)
- **Data Validation:** Proper validation and error handling
- **Integration:** Connect with existing models (Lead, Contact, or Reminder)
- **Testing:** Minimum of 5 unit tests covering key functionality

### 2. Frontend (Vue 3 + Vuetify)
- **New Page/Component:** Dedicated UI for your feature
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, delete functionality
- **User Experience:** Loading states, error handling, form validation
- **Integration:** Update existing pages to show/link to your feature
- **Responsive Design:** Should work on desktop and tablet

### 3. Code Quality
- Clean, readable, maintainable code
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Meaningful variable/function names
- Comments for complex logic
- Proper error handling

### 4. Testing
- At least 5 meaningful tests

- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Create reusable components where appropriate
- Use Vuetify components effectively
- Handle loading and error states
- Write clean, maintainable JavaScript/Vue code

### Testing Best Practices
- Test business logic, not just CRUD operations
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested
- Include positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Questions & Clarifications

If you have questions about the requirements:
1. Make reasonable assumptions and document them in your `SOLUTION.md`
2. If something is truly blocking, you may email dev@smartstaffingsupport.com
 for clarification
3. We value your ability to make good technical decisions independently

## Important Notes

- **Scope appropriately** - Choose a feature you can complete well in 48 hours
- **Code must run successfully** - We will test your submission
- **Original work only** - Don't copy solutions from the internet
- **Quality over quantity** - a well-implemented focused feature beats a half-finished ambitious one
- **Show your strengths** - Choose a feature that lets you demonstrate what you're good at
- **It's okay to be creative** - We value innovation and original thinking
